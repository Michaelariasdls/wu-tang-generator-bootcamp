# ðŸŽ¤Project: Wu-Tang Name Generator

This is my Wu-tang Name Generator project, a cool web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's all about handing the user a random Wu-tang inspired name based on the answers the user's make. Take a look at a screenshot to see my work in action.

## How It's Made

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with my favorite front-end framework to create this project. This project was made using Arrays, & objects, I enjoyed creating this project, and I'm excited to share my journey.

## Lessons Learned

As an aspiring engineer, I reinforced my confidence with arrays & objects with this project! if i ever become a rapper i will be using this application to get my name. S/O Donald Glover
